- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marcelo-San
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript, but I see there's still a long way to go.
- 💞️ I hope to soon be able to collaborate with great projects that help people to have a better life, with more awareness of their responsibilities as a global citizen.
